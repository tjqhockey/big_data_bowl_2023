Big Data Bowl 2023: An Elo Model to Evaluate NFL Linemen

I have come a long way since submitting this. It's not my best work, but I want this site to be comprehensive. I think there is a decent idea somewhere in here, but our writing and visualizations were not good enough and we completely disregarded the tracking data, which is the best part of the Big Data Bowl.

Unfortunately I lost the code used to create our visualizations, but I can include .png's and it is pretty clear what we used in ggplot to make them.
